# Travel_Agency

c-sharp-travel-agency
A console application for interacting with travel agency data.

Tasks
1. Set up your solution, create some classes
Create a new .NET 5.0 solution with a Console Application project (your main project) and an xUnit test project
Create Hotel, Customer and Employee classes - structure these classes around the data in the JSON files
You'll notice some repetition between the the Customer and Employee classes - can you DRY it up a bit?
Write constructors for your classes that allow you to set some initial values, write unit tests to check the constructors behave as you'd expect
2. Interact with the console
Create another class - ConsoleService - that reads a user’s name from the console and prints a custom greeting message (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.console?view=net-5.0)
Don't worry about unit testing the output of the console (Console is not a class you've written), just verify it's working by reading the output
3. Load your JSON data
Create an Agency class with two properties - Employees (a list of employees) and Hotels (a list of hotels)
When the constructor for the Agency class is invoked, these lists should be populated with the data from the JSON files. This will require you to read the files (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.file?view=net-5.0) and deserialize them from JSON (https://www.newtonsoft.com/json)
Write unit tests to ensure that the data you expect is being loaded into the Agency class
[OPTIONAL] Aim to have one underlying method that is responsible for reading both the employees and hotels JSON files
[OPTIONAL] separate all JSON-loading functionality into a separate class, then use an instance of that class to load your data
4. Print your data to the console
Go back to the ConsoleService class you created in step 2. After the user has been greeted, list two options to the user (“A - Read Hotels”, “B - Read Employees”)

Expand the ConsoleService functionality to print the Name and Id of each Hotel if the user selects A.

Expand the ConsoleService functionality to print the Name and Id of each Employee if the user selects B.

Don't worry about unit testing the output of the console (Console is not a class you've written), just verify it's working by reading the output {"mode":"full","isActive":false}
